# Telco Customer Churn Analytics | SQL + Python + Power BI

## Project Overview

This end-to-end data analytics project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecommunications company.  
The objective was to identify key churn drivers, quantify revenue impact, and provide strategic recommendations to reduce customer attrition.

This project demonstrates the complete analytics workflow — from data extraction to business insight generation.



## Project Architecture

- **SQL** – Data extraction, filtering, joins, and aggregations  
- **Python** – Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard development  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations and revenue impact metrics  



## Business Objective

Reduce churn rate from **47.89% to below 35% within 6 months** through targeted retention strategies.



## Tech Stack

- **SQL** – Data querying & aggregation  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data preprocessing & EDA  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations (Revenue Lost, Churn Rate, Revenue at Risk)



## Key KPIs

- Total Customers: 996  
- Churned Customers: 477  
- Churn Rate: 47.89%  
- Revenue Lost: $34.47K  
- Revenue at Risk: 49.62%  
- Average Monthly Charges: $69.74  



## Key Insights

- Month-to-Month contracts drive the highest churn  
- Electronic Check users show elevated churn risk  
- Higher monthly charges correlate with churn  
- Short-tenure customers are most vulnerable  
- Nearly 50% of revenue is at risk  



## Strategic Recommendations

✔ Promote long-term contracts with incentives  
✔ Encourage auto-pay enrollment  
✔ Improve the first 90-day onboarding experience  
✔ Introduce flexible pricing tiers  



## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- SQL Aggregations & Joins  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization & Storytelling  
- KPI Design with DAX  
- Business Insight Generation  



## Outcome

This project highlights how data analytics can transform raw customer data into actionable business strategies aimed at improving retention and reducing revenue loss.
